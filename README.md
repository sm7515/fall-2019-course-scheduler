# NYU Scheduler

**Description**

Our project is to create a more responsive course scheduler from NYU's course selection. The user can create their schedule by selecting a class and having it displayed on a scheduler without having to select the course one at a time.

**History**

Initially, we were developing an virtual NYU card that can use phone signals to trigger responses on the NYU building readers. However, due to restrictions, we were not able to develop such a program. 
We then thought of what services that could have been improved on and we thought that selecting classes on NYU was not a smooth process. We would like to expedite the process by creating a interactive scheduler.
